Things to be aware of as we start coding:
- There should be the ability to adapt to different DFS sites (DraftKings has different rules that FanDuel)
- There should be the ability to tweak the roster generation algorithm
  - Ignore player x
  - Set a min/max player price
  - Change a players expected points
  - Change PAYROLL_IN_DOLLARS
- Code should be able to generate the x best rosters
  - Adjust the roster variety (so the top 10 rosters don't all necessarily have Steph Curry)
