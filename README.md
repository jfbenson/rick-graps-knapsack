Things to be aware of as we start coding:
	- There should be the ability to adapt to different DFS sites (DraftKings has different rules that FanDuel)
	- There should be the ability to tweak the roster generation algorithm
		o Ignore player x
		o Set a min/max player price
		o Change a players expected points
		o Change PAYROLL_IN_DOLLARS
	- Code should be able to generate the x best rosters
		o Adjust the roster variety (so the top 10 rosters don't all necessarily have Steph Curry)
